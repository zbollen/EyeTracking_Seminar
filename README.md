# EyeTracking_Seminar

The repository contains 3 folders:
1) raw data: all the original and unmodified raw data from participants tested during the lab session (students and guests)
2) parser: the parser for eye-tracking raw data
3) script files: the pre-processing scripts (one script to complete in class and one script with answers)

You should download the repository on your computer and do not change the location of the files and folders inside to not disrupt the relative paths defined in the R scripts.

Have a look on the raw data of your participants before the next session (data for each participant is contained in 5 files: validation, calibration, behavioral, gaze and configuration).
