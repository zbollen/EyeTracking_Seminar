# EyeTracking_Seminar

The data-analyses folder contains:
1) all the raw data from participants tested during the lab session (students and guests)
2) the parser for eye-tracking raw data
3) the pre-processing scripts (one script to complete in class and one script with answers)

You should download the data-analysis folder on your computer and do not change the location of the files inside to not disrupt the relative paths defined in the R scripts.
