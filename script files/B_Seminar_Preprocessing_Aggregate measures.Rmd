```

# Merge all files

## Load and merge gaze-behavioural data of all participants

```{r warning=FALSE}
#set the path
PreprocessMainDir <- '../preprocessed data'
AllSubDirFix <- "Each_Part_Fix_Outputs"

setwd(file.path(PreprocessMainDir, AllSubDirFix))

#load and merge all participants data
files_to_upload <- list.files(pattern="*.csv")
theData_list <-lapply(files_to_upload, read.csv)

```

## Data check

Check if all participants data are available by printing the number of participants and their individual participant codes.

```{r}

unique(All_Part_Data$part_ID)
```

## Save merged data into a single file

```{r warning=FALSE}

# Aggregate measures
